# Minesweeper

This is a Minesweeper game made in JavaScript (using the p5 graphics library). It will work with both mouse and touch inputs, and has been tested on Chrome on my phone, and on both Chrome and IE11 on the desktop.

It includes the ability to left click (tap) to reveal a block, right click (long tap) to flag a block, and has a timer that shows the amount of time you have been playing. Flagged blocks cannot be revealed until they are unflagged by right clicking on them again. The rules are standard Minesweeper rules.
